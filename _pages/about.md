I am a PhD candidate in Information Systems at Questrom School of Business at Boston University. 


I study the effect of artificial intelligence on businesses. Specifically, my research focuses on how artificial intelligence
interpretability affects managerial decision-making processes under uncertainty. Additionally, I have worked on 
platform markets with network effects and patient management in healthcare throughout my studies.
