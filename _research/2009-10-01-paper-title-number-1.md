title: "Low Blood Pressure Threshold for Adverse Outcomes During Left Ventricular Assist Device Support"
collection: research
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'It has been suggested that maintaining low mean arterial pressure (MAP) in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients is associated with a reduced risk of stroke/death.
However, the provided recommendation for lower limit of the MAP range has not been established.
In this work, we propose that maintaining MAP less than 75 mmHg during long-term follow-up in LVAD recepients is associated with increased risk of stroke/death.

It has been suggested that maintaining low mean arterial pressure (MAP) in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients is associated with a reduced risk of stroke/death.
However, the provided recommendation for lower limit of the MAP range has not been established.
In this work, we propose that maintaining MAP less than 75 mmHg during long-term follow-up in LVAD recepients is associated with increased risk of stroke/death.
